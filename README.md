Digital Scale+ is a weight scale utilising the 3D Touch capability to measure weight. [Try the web app](https://digital-scale.app.wern.cc/) in Safari using your iPhone with 3D Touch (iPhone 6S/7/8/X/XS ONLY). This web app can also be saved to your home screen on iOS 12 and later.

To measure the weight of an object, place something on the screen that can be registered as a touch. If it can’t be registered, you can place a metal or conductive spoon on the screen, tare the weight and place the object on the spoon. You can tare the weight by touching the weight label.

If you have changed your 3D Touch sensitivity before, please change it in this app’s settings.
